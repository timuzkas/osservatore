I need you to follow theese guidlines while making UI:
 - use Apple Design Guidelines
 - use Apple HIG
 - use smooth animations
 - no sloppy drop shadows
 - clean icons
 - always think of responsiveness of the app
 - security: on user input, validate user input, santize it
 - use modern, setif typography.

 
 for backend, you acn use any language you want, but make sure it's secure and scalable.
 preferable, Goland or C++;
